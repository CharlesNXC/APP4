# ðŸ¤– Deterministic Finite Automata

A graphical Python application for planning, simulating, and exporting robotic mission plans using **Finite State Machines (FSMs)**

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Context

The goal is for autonomous robots to perform coordinated soccer actions (passes, blocks, shots) based on centralized planning. FSMs help encode behaviors.

Our tool allows users to:
- Convert natural-language instructions into a sequence of elementary robotic actions.
- Dynamically generate FSMs from these tasks.
- Simulate the FSM to observe success/failure outcomes.
- Export the FSM and logs in JSON and TXT formats.

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Instruction parsing 
- âœ… Action mapping to elementary tasks 
- âœ… FSM generation with probability
- âœ… Step-by-step FSM simulation (with success/failure feedback)
- âœ… PyQt5 graphical user interface
- âœ… FSM diagram
- âœ… Export to JSON and TXT 
- âœ… Built-in Help/Instructions panel (to enter tasks)

## ðŸ‘¥â€‹ Group work

- First we all worked on different version of the main code to understand how it works.
- Then **Simon & Charles** finished the main code while **Adrien & Thomas** worked on the interface and displaying the simulation properly

---
## ðŸ§  AI Contribution

We used **ChatGPT** to assist us in:
- Understanding the FSM logic.
- Debugging and improving the simulation.
- Designing the layout and help window contents.

We reviewed, modified, and adapted the content generated by AI to make sure it corresponded to our project.

## ðŸš€ Installation & launch

- To launch the app, simply launch python, then use the help menu to write instructions.
  
### Requirements
```bash
pip install PyQt5
