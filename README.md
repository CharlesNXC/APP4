# ðŸ¤– RoboFSM Planner

A graphical Python application for planning, simulating, and exporting robotic mission plans using **Finite State Machines (FSMs)** â€” specifically designed for the RoboCup Small Size League (SSL).

This project was developed as part of the **Advanced Algorithmics 3** course (APP4) at ESME, following a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) methodology.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Context

In RoboCup SSL, autonomous robots must perform coordinated soccer actions (passes, blocks, shots) based on centralized planning. FSMs help encode consistent, reactive behavior.

Our tool allows users to:
- Convert natural-language instructions into a sequence of elementary robotic actions.
- Dynamically generate FSMs from these tasks.
- Simulate the FSM to observe success/failure outcomes.
- Export the FSM and logs in JSON and TXT formats.

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Instruction parsing (e.g., "Pass and shoot")
- âœ… Action mapping to elementary tasks (e.g., GO_TO_BALL, PASS, SHOOT)
- âœ… Dynamic FSM generation with probabilistic transitions
- âœ… Step-by-step FSM simulation (with success/failure feedback)
- âœ… PyQt5 graphical user interface
- âœ… FSM text diagram
- âœ… Export to JSON and TXT (FSM + log)
- âœ… Built-in Help/Instructions panel

## ðŸ§  AI Contribution

This project was enhanced using **OpenAI's ChatGPT**, which assisted in:
- Designing the code architecture and FSM logic.
- Creating docstrings, modular structure, and comments.
- Writing this `README.md` and documentation.
- Debugging and improving the simulation flow.
- Designing the GUI layout and help window contents.

All AI-generated suggestions were reviewed, validated, and adapted by the project team to ensure relevance and correctness in the academic context.
